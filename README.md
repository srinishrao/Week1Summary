## What I Learned

### Day 1 – Variables, Data Types, Operators
- Understood Java syntax, primitive data types, and arithmetic operations.
- Built a basic calculator using `Scanner`, `if` and `switch` statements.
- Handled division by zero cases.
- **Project Commit**: `Basic Calculator using Java`

### Day 2 – Control Flow (if, switch)
- Practiced decision-making using nested `if` and `switch` statements.
- Created a Loan Eligibility Checker based on user input.
- **Project Commit**: `Loan Eligibility Checker`

### Day 3 – Loops (for, while)
- Learned about `for` and `while` loops.
- Generated all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using nested loops.
- **Project Commit**: `Prime Number Generator`

### Day 4 – Arrays & Strings
- Worked with strings and arrays.
- Implemented:
  - A **String Reversal** using `StringBuilder`
  - A **Palindrome Checker** comparing original vs reversed string
- **Project Commit**: `String Reversal and Palindrome Checker`

### Day 5 – Methods
- Gained hands-on experience in writing modular Java code using methods.
- Built:
  - A **Factorial Calculator**
  - A **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**
- **Project Commit**: `Factorial and Fibonacci using Methods`

### Day 6 – OOP Basics (Class, Object)
- Learned object-oriented principles: class, object, attributes, methods.
- Designed a `Car` class with custom methods to demonstrate object behavior.
- **Project Commit**: `Car Class with Attributes and Methods`

- **Code Quality**: Improved with each day by applying best practices like method reuse, input validation, and meaningful naming conventions.
- **Version Control**: Used Git consistently, committing after every task with descriptive messages.
